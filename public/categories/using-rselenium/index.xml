      <description>I was approached to see if there was a way to web scrape several articles from PubMed. I normally like to use rvest for web scraping, but it would not work because of the java script used to run PubMed. Luckily, RSelenium provides a way to easily interact with websites of this nature. This was my first use of RSelenium, but now I have a lot more efficient ways of using RSelenium and rvest together, although I am sure there are still better ways out there.</description>
